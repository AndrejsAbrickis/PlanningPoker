# PlanningPoker
This is a proof of concept application to demonstrate how to start developing AspNetCore with SignalR. You can read the recap about the process of developing this demo here https://medium.com/@andrejsabrickis/recap-creating-a-demo-of-real-time-communication-app-using-aspnetcore-signalr-d8ac0afba081

There are lot of hacks and shortcuts in the code to make it posibble to push out an POC version of this app. I'm looking forward to find some spare time to polish this. And hopefully one day it could be good enought to use for an agile teams to estimate their work.

Any help, comments and critique is more than welcome!
